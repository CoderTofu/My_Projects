Feel free to look around, use my code or take inspiration from them.

Maybe sometimes you'll see me pushing unfinished projects lol.

These projects are what I do in my free-time while learning JS for 2021.

I don't know how many "projects" I'll put here but I'll probably move on from JS by EOY.

Godspeed.
